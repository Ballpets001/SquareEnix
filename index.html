          Square Enix Holdings Co., Ltd. is a Japanese video for its Final
          Fantasy, Dragon Quest and Kingdom Hearts role-playing video game
          franchises, among numerous others. In 2009, Square Enix Holdings
          acquired British game publisher Eidos Interactive, which was absorbed
          into Square Enix Europe to publish titles such as Tomb Raider, Deus Ex
          and Just Cause. In 2005, Square Enix acquired arcade gaming
          corporation Taito, known for games such as Space Invaders, Bubble
          Bobble, and Darius. Outside of video game publishing and development,
          Square Enix is also in the business of merchandise, arcade/amusement
          facilities, and manga publication under its Gangan Comics brand.
          Several of its games franchises have sold over 10 million copies
          worldwide, with the Final Fantasy franchise selling 144 million, the
          Dragon Quest franchise selling 78 million and the Kingdom Hearts
          franchise selling 30 million.Square Enix is headquartered in the
          Shinjuku Eastside Square Building in Shinjuku, Tokyo and has over 5000
          employees worldwide through its base operations and subsidiaries. The
          original Square Enix Co., Ltd. was formed in April 2003 due to a
          merger between Square and Enix, with the latter as the surviving
          company. Each share of Square's common stock was exchanged for 0.85
          shares of Enix's common stock. At the time, 80% of Square Enix staff
          were made up of former Square employees. As part of the merger, former
          Square president Yoichi Wada was appointed the president of the new
          corporation, while former Enix president Keiji Honda was named vice
          president. Yasuhiro Fukushima, the largest shareholder of the combined
          corporation and founder of Enix, became chairman. In October 2008,
          Square Enix conducted a company split between its corporate business
          and video game operations. Square Enix reorganized itself as Square
          Enix Holdings Co., Ltd., a holding company, while its internally
          domestic video game operations were formed as a new subsidiary called
          Square Enix Co., Ltd.
